## Troubleshooting

### If Super Admin Login Doesn't Work
1. Check that the `super_admins` table has the correct email
2. Verify the authentication logic in `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
3. Check browser console for errors

### If School Creation Fails
1. Verify RLS policies are set correctly
2. Check Supabase logs for errors
3. Ensure all required tables exist

### If You Get Permission Errors
1. Make sure you're using the service role key (not anon key)
2. Check that RLS policies allow super admin access
3. Verify database URL is correct

## Files Created/Modified

- `database-complete-reset.sql` - Main reset script
- `reset-database.sh` - Bash execution script
- `reset-database.js` - Node.js execution script
- `DATABASE_RESET_GUIDE.md` - This guide

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error messages carefully
2. Verify your environment variables
3. Test database connectivity
4. Check Supabase project status
5. Review the authentication flow in the application

The goal is to get a clean, working system where only the super admin functionality works initially, and then gradually add other features as needed.
