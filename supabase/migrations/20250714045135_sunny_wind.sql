  # Fix infinite recursion in school_admins RLS policy

  1. Problem
    - The existing RLS policy on school_admins table causes infinite recursion
    - Policy checks for existence in the same table it's trying to access
    - This prevents all database operations involving school_admins

  2. Solution
    - Drop the problematic recursive policy
    - Create separate, non-recursive policies for different operations
    - Allow users to manage their own school_admin records
    - Allow school admins to insert new records for their school

  3. Security
    - Users can only view/modify their own school_admin records
    - School admins can create new admin records for their school
    - Maintains data isolation between schools

-- Allow authenticated users to insert school_admin records
