**Mock Schools:**

- Green Valley High School (greenvalley.skooler.com)
- Bright Future Academy (brightfuture.skooler.com)

**Mock Administrators:**

- John Smith (admin@greenvalley.edu)
- Sarah Johnson (admin@brightfuture.edu)

**Mock Audit Logs:**

- School creation events
- Admin creation events
- Password reset events
- System login events

### Error Handling

- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to mock data when services unavailable
